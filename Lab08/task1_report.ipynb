Thus B x 29 parameters of each of 5 targets were obtained. The variance of the parameters was then investigated, which demonstrated that all the parameters significantly vary across the subsamples (variance typically exceeding mean value) meaning that such a model cannot be used for making relaible predictions on such data. More precisely, overfitting cannot be avoided in this case."
